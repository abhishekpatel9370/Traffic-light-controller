# Traffic-light-controller
I made this traffic light controller in verilog to handle the traffic in highway or street road 
In a highway if there is a traffic light singal present between the city road and highway road it as a timmer of 60 sec it .So even if no vehicle is present in the city road the light signal red ligt to the highway road untill the counter turn to zero .
To overcome this problem we addtched the sensor to traffic light controller which detect the vehicle is present or not in the city or highway road if there is wo vehicle is present on the city road then the counter increase by 10 sec of highway road same or city road but in case of city road the timmer is of 50 sec and in case of highway the couunter is of 60 sec .
This change in the signal will helps to reduce the uneven wait of vehicle in the road when the vehicle is not present on the either side road
